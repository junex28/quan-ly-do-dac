ArcGIS Sample JavaScript Viewer - Readme.txt

*****************************************************************************


SUPPORTED BROWSERS:

The developers of the JavaScript Viewer have attempted to make it as cross-browser
compatible as possible. However, the limitations of some browsers mean that
they are not fully capable of rendering the user interface of the JS Viewer. 

Due to differences in browser support of both JavaScript and Cascading Style 
Sheets (CSS) the Sample JavaScript Viewer is best viewed with Firefox 3+ and
Safari 3+ web browsers.

Firefox (3+) and Safari (3.1+) are fully supported and are the A-level platforms.
Internet Explorer 7 is supported, but has some cosmetic limitations.
Internet Explorer 6 runs, but is not supported.
Internet Explorer 8 has not been tested. This may change when the browser is released.
Google Chrome has not been tested. This may change when the browser reaches 1.0.



Directions:
-----------

Step 1:

Copy the JSViewer directory onto your web server so that it can be 
accessed as a website or virtual directory.
Example:  Copy the JSViewer directory under C:\Inetpub\wwwroot for 
Microsoft IIS web servers. 

** For IIS only **
Open the IIS Default Web Site in Computer Management:

.: [IMPORTANT] Make sure the JSViewer directory is an application, not 
   a folder. The proxy will not work otherwise.

.: [Optional but recemmended] Add new MIME type into IIS:
   json     application/jason


Step 2:
 
The JSViewer directory contains “config.xml” which is the main 
configuration file. Open the config.xml file in the JSViewer directory 
using a text editor like Notepad. Make necessary changes to the XML tags. 
See the "Description of XML Configuration Files" section below for more 
information.


Step 3:
 
The JSViewer\js\com\esri\solutions\jsviewer\widgets\config directory contains widget 
configuration files (.xml/.json). Make necessary changes to the configuration files 
using a text editor like Notepad. To add multiple instances of the same 
widget, define multiple configuration files for each widget and add a 
reference for the widget to the main config.xml file specifying the 
appropriate configuration file. See the "Description of XML Configuration 
Files" section below for more information.


Step 4:

Test the application in a browser by entering the URL to the index.html page. 
Example: http://<server>/JSViewer/index.html
Substitute "<server>" with name of your server.


Optional:

Configure additional NLS language support. In the
JSViewer\js\com\esri\solutions\jsviewer\nls directory and
JSViewer\js\com\esri\solutions\jsviewer\widgets\nls, there are files
containing the language configurations for en, en-us, and fr. Create a directory
named for the language code you wish (ex. "es" for Spanish). Copy the files from
the default \nls directory into your new subdirectory. Open each file with a text
editor such as Notepad and change the text inside to reflect the language code.
Generally, HTML entities for non-English characters are supported. (ex. "&eacute;")
In other cases, try entering the character code. (ex. ALT-0233 -> é)


Notes:
------

1) Base maps are map services which users can toggle between. Only one base 
map is visible at any given time.


2) Live maps are map services that can be overlaid on top of the base maps.


3) Results from widgets like LiveLayer, Locate and GeoRSS are displayed using 
Graphics Layers and cannot be projected on the fly.  
Please make sure the coordinate system of the data used for widgets matches 
the coordinate system of the primary map service.
The primary map service is the first base map service that gets added to the map.


4) All images provided with the JavaScript Viewer are stored in the 
JSViewer\js\com\esri\solutions\jsviewer\assets directory.  
These can be changed or substituted as required but maintain the same size 
and format for best results.

=======================================
PROXY SETUP:
=======================================
  
Whenever the JavaScript Viewer needs to make a behind-the-scenes request for data from
the Internet, there is the possibility that your browser will stop the request due to
security concerns. In order to avoid this, one of three proxying schemes must be used, depending
on how the JavaScript Viewer is deployed.

php: 

The JavaScript Viewer is being served via the Apache web server and the PHP module is available.
Open the proxy.php file in the JSViewer directory using a text editor such as Notepad. Add any
Internet servers which you wish to access to the list in the first few lines of proxy.php.

jsp:

The JavaScript Viewer is being served via a Java application server such as Tomcat. Open the proxy.jsp
file in the JSViewer directory using a text editor such as Notepad. Add any Internet servers which
you wish to access to the list in the first few lines of proxy.jsp.

asp:

The JavaScript Viewer is being served via the Microsoft IIS web server. The JavaScript Viewer uses proxy.ashx
in the JSViewer directory to proxy. Open proxy.config. Add XML elements for any Internet servers which
you wish to access.


=======================================
WEB SERVER SETUP: (IIS in particular)
=======================================

MIME types required by the JavaScript Viewer:
  .json - text/plain
  .kml - application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml
